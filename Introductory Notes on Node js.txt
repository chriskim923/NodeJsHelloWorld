1) We need to make a package.json file
2) Run $npm init
	-Whatever is in parenthesis is the default if you press enter
	-Lets just call it myapp
	-Version default is fine
	-Description: Simple test app
	-Entry point (this is the main file): keep it as app.js that we made earlier in this folder
	-Skip: test command, git repository, keywords, author, license
3) Now we have a package.json file
4) Open up app.js
5) We will now create a basic web server
6) Start with a variable const http = require('http');
